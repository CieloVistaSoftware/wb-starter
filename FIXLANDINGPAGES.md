# FIXLANDINGPAGES

## Purpose

This document tracks the process and checklist for fixing all landing pages (home and other key pages) in the WB Behaviors project. It is part of the ongoing codebase cleanup and quality improvement effort.

## Background

Recent test results and audits revealed broken links, missing files, and rendering issues on several key pages. The builder artifacts have been archived, and the next priority is to ensure all main pages render correctly and are free of broken/missing assets.

## Checklist

- [ ] Identify all key landing pages (home, navigation, demos, etc.)
- [ ] Check for broken/missing files and links on each page
- [ ] Validate page structure and syntax
- [ ] Restore or replace critical assets
- [ ] Test rendering in browser and via automated tests
- [ ] Document all fixes and changes

## Progress Log

- 2026-02-14: Document created. Builder artifacts archived, manifest updated, and commit completed. Ready to proceed with landing page fixes.
