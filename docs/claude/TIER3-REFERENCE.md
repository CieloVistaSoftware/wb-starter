# TIER 3 — REFERENCE (Don't Read Unless Specifically Needed)

**These docs exist for historical context, audits, or external publishing.**  
**Never read these at session start. Only pull them in if John points you here or the task explicitly requires it.**

## 📂 SAFELY IGNORABLE

These folders/files can always be ignored:

| Path | Why |
|------|-----|
| `tmp/` | Temporary files, integration runs, playwright artifacts |
| `archive/` | Archived old files |
| `data/test-results/*/error-context.md` | Auto-generated test failure context (dozens of files) |
| `Lock/*.md` | Lock files — Tier 1 says check the folder, but you don't need to read every lock file's contents |

---

## The Rule

**If you're reading a Tier 3 doc during a normal session, you're probably going too deep.** These docs exist so John doesn't lose institutional knowledge, not so AI reads them every time. Stick to Tier 1 (always) and Tier 2 (when relevant to the task).
